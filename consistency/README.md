## About

Why should I be consistent?

[Consistency](https://www.tuple.nl/en/knowledge-base/consistency) in software development eases readability and understanding. This reduces the learning curve during collaboration and maintenance. But how is consistency established when there's nuance in everything? I personally believe there are 3 ways to establish this:

1. Standards. I borrow the definition from [ISO standards](https://www.iso.org/standards.html), where standards are a set of rules to be **strictly followed** without deviation. Because of the "strictness", new standards must go through rigorous testing before being added.
2. Best Practices. The definition for both "Best Practice" and "Guideline" is best defined in this [W3C email](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-ldp-wg/2013Jul/0006.html), although Wikipedia definitions for "[Best Practice](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_best_practices)" and "[Guideline](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Guideline)" are also accepted for clarification purposes. Best Practices are methods or techniques that consistently show results superior to those achieved with other means and are used as a benchmark. Best Practices are **opinionated**, in other words, they are specific, and if not applicable to your use case, then developer discretion can be applied on whether Best Practices should be adhered to.
3. Guidelines. A Guideline is a tip, a trick, a note, a suggestion, or answer to a frequently asked question. These are personal tips that **can be ignored** if a better implementation exists. Hence, guidelines can change frequently.

Document format is as such, where `consistency_type` is either Standard, Best Practice, or Guideline.

## [Git](https://git-scm.com)

### [Standard] [Commit Message Format](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) by Angular

"type" field must be strictly be in [types](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#type).

### [Standard] [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org)

"v" prefix is still used for [git tag](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-tag) names in the following format as documented [here](https://semver.org/#is-v123-a-semantic-version):

```bash
git tag v1.2.3 -m "Release version 1.2.3"
```

Each release is to be documented in CHANGELOG, which is in the format of [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0).

## JavaScript

### [Best Practice] [Prettier](https://prettier.io) Code Formatter

JavaScript unfortunately does not have a definitive style guide. However, [Prettier](https://prettier.io), the most popular formatter, loosely documents its rationale [here](https://prettier.io/docs/en/rationale).

## [Python](https://python.org)

### [Best Practice] [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008) Style Guide

PEP 8 is the definitive style guide for Python. Despite being relatively unopinionated, [autopep8](https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8) is the chosen formatter as [black](https://github.com/psf/black) sacrifices readability for consistency. As stated in [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008), "sometimes style guide recommendations just arenâ€™t applicable. When in doubt, use your best judgment."

## [Shell](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash)

### [Guideline] [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net)

A static analysis tool for shell scripts.

### [Standard] [Shell Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html) by Google

Google's Shell Style Guide is the most popular style guide for Shell. Formatted by [shfmt](https://github.com/mvdan/sh) with the following flags as specified in the [documentation](https://github.com/mvdan/sh/blob/master/cmd/shfmt/shfmt.1.scd#examples):

```bash
shfmt -i 2 -ci -bn
```

## Miscellaneous
